# Data Analysis with Pandas and Numpy

This repository contains tools and examples for performing data analysis using Python. The main libraries used are `pandas` and `numpy`, with additional support from `matplotlib` for plotting and `openpyxl` for Excel file operations.

In the data directory, there is a file named `youtube-ing.rar` don't forget to extract it from rar before using it.

This repository is still a work in progress

## Features

- **Data Manipulation**: Efficient data manipulation and analysis using `pandas` and `numpy`.
- **Data Visualization**: Create plots and visualizations using `matplotlib`.
- **Excel Integration**: Read from and write to Excel files using `openpyxl`.

### Configuration

No specific configuration is needed. Simply ensure that your data files are placed in the appropriate directory, and modify the scripts as needed to point to your data sources.
